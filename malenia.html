            Malenia was born the child of Queen Marika the Eternal and her second husband, the Elden Lord Radagon. She had an elder twin brother by the name of Miquella. Both Malenia and Miquella were Empyreans, meaning they had the potential to one day replace their mother as a new god of a coming age. But since Radagon and Marika were in fact the same person, Malenia and Miquella were born afflicted. Malenia was afflicted with the Scarlet Rot, which ravaged her from within and would cost her several limbs, while Miquella was afflicted with 
            eternal childhood, unable to ever grow into adulthood.<br>
            At some point, Malenia encountered a blind swordsman who had 
            sealed away an Outer God of Rot. The swordsman became her 
            master, and trained her in the ways of the blade, allowing her to 
            gain wings of unparalleled strength.<br>
            Malenia would eventually become a warrior without peer. She would attract loyal 
            servants like her Cleanrot Knights (who vowed to fight 
            next to her despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction 
            of their flesh), as well as worshippers, who believed 
            her to be a goddess.<br>
            Members of House Marais, 
            who were all sickly born, were naturally drawn to the beautiful and fierce Malenia who became such a powerful warrior in spite of being born into rot, and requiring prostheses to fight.</p>

            <p>I dreamt for so long. My flesh was dull gold... and my blood, rotted. Corpse after corpse, left in my wake. As I awaited... his return. Heed my words. I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella. And I have never known defeat.</p>

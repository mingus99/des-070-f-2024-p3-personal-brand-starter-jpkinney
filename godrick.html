            <p>Godrick is a descendant of the Golden Lineage, the bloodline which began with Queen Marika the Eternal and her first consort Godfrey. Only a distant relation of Marika's line, his divine blood was sorely diluted, and he was viewed as the runt of the litter.
                <br>
                After the Elden Ring was shattered, Godrick inherited the Great Rune from the centre of the Elden Ring, referred to as the anchor ring. During The Shattering, Godrick was hounded from the Leyndell, Royal Capital. He claimed a multitude of treasures, including the Mimic's Veil, and then hid amongst the womenfolk to flee the city.
                <br>
                Godrick made his way south, settling in Limgrave with an army made up of soldiers who had fled Leyndell. He took up residence in Stormveil Castle, using it as a refuge to hide from General Radahn, and as a place to practice grafting; a grotesque act which involves attaching parts of other living beings to oneself to gain power. When the Tarnished returned to the Lands Between, Godrick sent his soldiers on Tarnished hunts, seeking new subjects to graft. As well as performing the act upon himself, Godrick also produced the Grafted Scions; abhorrent beings comprised of many different limbs, seemingly grafted onto children.</p>

        The Golden Order has been shattered. Throughout the Lands Between, Demigods holding shards of the Elden Ring squabble and make war over the ruins of a perfect realm, now abandoned by the golden guidance of the Greater Will.<br>

        As the echoes of this conflict thunder in the distance, an outcast arrives. Once, their ancestors called the Lands Between home, but the blessed light of grace was lost to their tribe long ago and they were expelled from the kingdom. They are the Tarnished, and they have returned to claim the Elden Lordship promised to them by legend.<br>
        <br>

        This is the world of ELDEN RING. As a Tarnished, the Lands Between await your exploration. You will ride through the vast fields, gallop over rolling hills, and leap to the top of rocky crags on your ephemeral steed, revealing a world teeming with life and danger.<br>
        <br>

        In the grand fields where your journey begins, mythic creatures prowl the veldts, ineffable horrors lurk in the bogs and marshes, and all manner of soldiers and itinerant warriors are waiting for those who wander unawares. Shy creatures nibble on sweet grasses or scuttle through the underbrush.<br>
        <br>

        Those few inhabitants who are not mad or hostile linger near the broken remnants of cities left behind by the Shattering. They may have answers for you, if you help them. Above them all, ensconced in vast legacies bristling with traps, secrets, and guardians, the Demigods - warped Lords who began as members of a royal and noble family - rule their domains with the unyielding power granted by shards of the Elden Ring.

        The guidance of lost graces  should you find them - will put you on a road to re-take these lands from the Demigods through might and magic, but you need not follow their path.

        The choice is yours. Do you crave power, or do you seek understanding? Decide for yourself, then build your character as you see fit.<br>
        <br>

        Try dozens of skills and find one to best suit your style. Practice stealth to avoid danger or catch enemies unaware. Use the environment, the weather, and the time of day to gain an advantage.

        Learn the art of combat , where you must read your enemy's intentions and a well-timed dodge or parry could be the difference between life and death.

        Ride your steed into battle against mounted mercenaries and cut them from their horses. Master arcane spells from the masters that still linger among the ruins of the war. 

        Summon familiar spirits to even the odds against you or call on your fellow Tarnished to fight at your side and share the burden as you explore.
        
        Or, delve into the complex, bloody history of the Shattering and discover the lost secrets of the Demigods and their kin. All these paths are possible, and more.<br>
        <br>

        Ultimately, your journey will be defined by the strength of your own ambition. The greater your goals, the greater the challenge will be. Should you choose to claim the Lands Between as your birthright then yes, you must fight.
        <br> 
    </p>
    <p id="bottomtext">
        And yes, you may die.<br>

        But you will return to fight again.<br>
        
        For that is how a champion or a Lord is born.<br>

    <h2>The Knight of The Black Knives</h2>
    <p>During the Golden Age of the Erdtree, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen by Lunar Princess Ranni, who used it to forge godslaying knives. These knives were used by the Black Knife Assassins who, one night, entered Leyndell and assassinated Godwyn the Golden. As the assassins fled the capital, an assassin named Tiche was killed protecting her mother Alecto, the leader of the assassins.
        <br><br>Ranni killed herself at the moment of Godwyn's death, causing the Cursemark to break into two half-wheels rather than form a circle. While Ranni died in the flesh, Godwyn's soul alone perished, sentencing him to live in death. His body was interred in the Erdtree's roots beneath Leyndell, where it mutated and warped. Later, the Rune of Death began to spread through the roots in the form of Deathroot, giving rise to Those Who Live in Death.
        <br><br>The Night of Black Knives became the catalyst for the Shattering. In response to Godwyn's death, Queen Marika the Eternal used her hammer to shatter the Elden Ring. Elden Lord Radagon, her alter ego, attempted in vain to repair the Elden Ring. As punishment for her offense, the goddess Marika was imprisoned within the Erdtree.
            Consequently, the shattering of the Elden Ring corrupted the Golden Order, and lead to a Shattering War that would leave the Lands Between in ruin.
        
            The shards of the Elden Ring, known as Great Runes, were inherited by Marika's Demigod offspring. Tainted by the strength of the Great Runes, the Demigods warred, with the conflict becoming known as the Shattering.</p>
    <h1>THE SHATTERING</h1>
    <a href="malenia.html"><img id ="caelid" src="images/battleForCaelid.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></a>
    <h2>The Battle For Caelid</h2>
    <p>General Radahn, famed as the scourge of the stars, led the Redmane Knights during the Shattering. They were met in battle by Malenia, Blade of Miquella, and her undefeated army of Cleanrot Knights. They fought to a standstill, until Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot, ending the duel inconclusively. Radahn was driven mad by the rot and was forced to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, devouring the corpses of those who died during the conflict, whether they be a friend or foe. Malenia, who became comatose, was carried back to the Haligtree of her brother Miquella by Cleanrot Knight Finlay, one of the few survivors of the battle.</p>

       

    <a href="morgott.html"><img src="images/morgott.jpg" width="50%"></a>
    <h2>Morgott Fighting Radahn</h2>
    <p>Morgott, a Demigod of the Golden Lineage who was born as a graceless Omen, inherited a Great Rune known as the anchor ring which houses the base, proving his pedigree as a member of the Golden Lineage and as the Lord of Leyndell. Taking on the moniker of the "veiled lord", Morgott ruled over Leyndell, slaughtering countless champions in defence of the Erdtree under the guise of Margit, the Fell Omen. </p>             
    <a href="rykard.html"><img src="images/Rykard.jpg" width="50%"></a>
    <h2>Rykard being Devoured by the Blasphemous Serpent</h2>    
    <p>Praetor Rykard, whose noble ambitions had turned to gluttonous depravity, fed himself to the blasphemous serpent after obtaining his Great Rune. His consort, Tanith, established the recusants of Volcano Manor, waging a war against the Erdtree in his stead.</p>
    <a href="godrick.html"><img src="images/ER_Godrick_the_Grafted.jpg" width="50%"></a>
    <h2>Godrick The Grafted</h2>
    <p>Godrick, a distant relation of Marika whose blood was sorely diluted, escaped the capital by hiding amongst the womenfolk, bringing with him a multitude of treasures including the Mimic's Veil. He hid from General Radahn in Stormveil Castle, and later insulted Malenia, only to grovel for mercy after he himself was defeated at her hands. He turned to the act of grafting in order to attain power, so that one day he could return to the capital.</p>  
    <a href="ranni.html"><img src="images/ranni.jpg" width="50%"></a>
    <h2>Ranni the Witch</h2>
    <p>Ranni, the instigator of the Night of Black Knives, is said to have cast aside her Great Rune, and its present whereabouts are unknown.</p>  
    <a href="mohg.html"><img src="images/Mohg.jpg" width="50%"></a>
    <h2>Mohg Kidnapping Miquella</h2>
    <p>Mohg, known only as the Lord of Blood, began building his dynasty underground in secret. To this end he abducted Miquella from his resting place in the Haligtree, wishing to raise the Empyrean to full godhood and become his consort.However, Miquella never responded to Mohg, no matter how hard the omen tried, and continued to remain asleep in his cocoon.</p>

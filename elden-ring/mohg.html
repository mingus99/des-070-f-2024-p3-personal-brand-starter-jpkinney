            <p>Mohg or Mohgwyn, also known as the Lord of Blood,<br>
            was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord,<br> 
            Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Morgott.<br> 
            The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined <br>
            and shackled to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below Leyndell.<br>

            Unlike his brother, Mohg would grow to embrace his Omen blood.</p> 
            
            <p>Deep underground, Mohg made contact with an Outer God known<br> 
                as the Formless Mother. The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood<br>
                 with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic.<br>
            
            After Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Mohg escaped confinement <br>
            and claimed one of the shards of the Elden Ring. During this period, <br>
            he began establishing his domain from Mohgwyn Palace and recruiting followers, <br>
            including his Sanguine Nobles and a band of Tarnished known as the Bloody Fingers. 
            Among these followers was Varr√©, a war surgeon who was able to successfully tame Mohg's accursed blood.
            
            The specific timing of Mohg assuming the title of Lord of Blood and the exact sequence of his activities relative to the Shattering are not well-documented, making the precise timeline of these events unclear.

            <p>Wishing to raise Miquella to full godhood, Mohg wished to become his consort, taking the role of monarch. But no matter how much of his bloody bedchamber he tried to share, he received no response from the young Empyrean.</p>

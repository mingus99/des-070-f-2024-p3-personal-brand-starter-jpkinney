            <p>Rykard was born the son of Radagon, a champion of the Erdtree, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. He had two siblings, Radahn and Ranni.
                <br>
                
                At some point, the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the Lands Between. Rykard's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become Queen Marika's new consort and the second Elden Lord. Rykard and his siblings were thus raised to demigods by their new step-mother, Marika.
                <br>
                
                Under the Golden Order, Rykard was a ruthless justiciar who commanded a company of inquisitors. His inquisitors persecuted and mercilessly tortured those considered heretics to the Golden Order, such as the Albinaurics. He spent time in the volcanic Mt. Gelmir, where he discovered the ancient magma hexes of a forgotten serpent-worshiping religion native to the region, which he brought back into practical use as new sorceries. Rykard also travelled to a foreign land where he encountered a dancer by the name of Tanith, who he would eventually take as his consort.
